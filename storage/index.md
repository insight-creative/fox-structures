Fox Structures has a significant track record building warehouse facilities both large and small. Customers like the fact that we perform all concrete work to ensure the slab foundation is done right. Once you’re ready to build, our crews can get your warehouse erected and operational in record time. We can build any size structure with any variety of stall configurations, plus install all doors and outside lighting — even get the drive area finished with gravel, asphalt or cement.
