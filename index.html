<p>Since 1982, Fox Structures has focused on two things: listening to customers and delivering what we promise. Thatâ€™s a pretty simple business plan for a design/build contractor. The fact is, it works.We believe that most customers already have a vision for what they want in a new facility. Maybe you do, too. If not, we'll provide the design services to integrate your ideas and needs into the ideal plan. You'll have our dedicated attention through every step of design and construction to ensure quality results in a timely and cost-efficient manner.</p>
