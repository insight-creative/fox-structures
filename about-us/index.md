# Fox Structures—Experts at Building Success.

### For expert agricultural and commercial construction in northeast Wisconsin, count on Fox Structures.

Since 1982 Fox Structures has focused on two things: listening to customers and delivering what we promise. That’s a pretty simple business plan for a design/build contractor. But it’s one that works. From planning and design, through construction to your final walk-through, you'll have our dedicated attention every step of the process. Fox Structures’ owners are even present on every job. This focus served us well and over the next decades we grew our agricultural and commercial portfolio, completing projects to our customer’s personal specifications, in the most cost-efficient manner, while always meeting our own demanding quality standards.

Today Fox Structures provides design and construction services for all types of agricultural, commercial, retail, light manufacturing and residential buildings. In addition, mini warehouses, storage facilities and special-use buildings have continued to fuel both our growth and progress.
