# Building Customer Satisfaction

Fox Structures began in 1982 to serve the building needs of agricultural and commercial customers throughout Northeast Wisconsin. During the 1990s, our ag construction work expanded significantly as farm operations shifted to larger, more sophisticated structures. At the same time, our commercial work grew to embrace a wide variety of buildings and facilities as business growth boomed throughout the area.

Many customers like the way Fox partners with them to create the ideal plan and work schedule. They appreciate our solid standards for quality work as well as our flexibility to meet their personal specifications. And with Fox owners involved on every project, it’s easy to ensure customer satisfaction from start to finish.

Today Fox Structures provides both design and construction services for all types of commercial, retail, agricultural, light manufacturing and residential buildings. In addition, mini warehouses, storage facilities and special use buildings have continued to fuel both our growth and success.

 
**It’s true. Our building success starts with you.**
